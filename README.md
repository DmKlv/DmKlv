## 👨‍💻 About Me
👋 Hello, I'm Dmitriy!I am a QA Engineer focused on delivering high-quality, reliable, and efficient software solutions. My experience spans both manual and automated testing, including the development and maintenance of robust test frameworks, CI/CD pipeline integration, and ensuring release stability.
I actively apply best testing practices to enhance transparency and predictability in the development process. My work is aimed at identifying critical issues early, optimizing testing workflows, and creating tools that make development faster and safer.
Collaboration with teams is a key aspect of my approach: I believe that knowledge sharing, teamwork, and active engagement from every team member are essential for project success. I enjoy solving real-world challenges, implementing innovative solutions, and improving existing tools to increase product quality.
I continuously develop my skills and follow modern automation approaches, including Selenium, Selenide, Cucumber, and Postman, while leveraging CI/CD pipelines to integrate testing into the development workflow. My goal is to create reliable, maintainable, and scalable solutions that help teams achieve maximum efficiency.
